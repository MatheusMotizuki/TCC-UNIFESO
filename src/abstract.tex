    Image editing tools have existed for a long time and, since their inception, these software solutions have always presented usability challenges for non-technical users. The aim of this work is to develop a simplified and more straightforward image editing application, specifically designed for end users without technical expertise. As a key differentiator, the project explores the use of visual technologies, employing visual programming based on directed graphs to make the editing process more intuitive and accessible.
