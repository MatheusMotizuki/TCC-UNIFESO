    Image editing tools have existed for a long time and, since their inception, these software solutions have always presented usability challenges for users without technical knowledge. The aim of this work is to develop a simplified and more straightforward image editing application. Creating such an application offers significant advantages, such as reducing the learning curve for new users and enabling individuals without technical experience to edit images effectively. Furthermore, the use of the dataflow programming paradigm provides a modular and flexible approach to image editing, facilitating experimentation and creativity for users.
